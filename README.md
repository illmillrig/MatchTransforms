# MatchTransforms

Maya still didnt get 'match transforms' right.  This will match in either local or global space. and has the option to match pivot.  Unlike Maya's match pivot though, this will use the pivots to match the object tranforms.  so in the case of frozen transforms, you can still match.

TODO: make this a command for undo/redo support
